# Landing Page

Welcome to my **Landing Page** project! This is a hands-on exercise in building a multi-section webpage using HTML and CSS. It showcases foundational web development skills, focusing on semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox, and responsive design principles.

## Key Features

- **Header**: A sleek navigation bar with a "Header Logo" on the left and links ("header link one", "header link two", "header link three") on the right, set against a dark background.
- **Hero Section**: A bold "This website is awesome" headline, supporting subtext, a "Sign up" button, and a placeholder image for visual appeal.
- **Information Section**: Four evenly spaced cards with placeholder illustrations and subtext ("this is some subtext under an illustration or image").
- **Quote Section**: A styled testimonial or quote ("This is an inspiring quote, or a testimonial from a customer...") attributed to "-Thor, God of Thunder".
- **Call-to-Action Banner**: A prominent section with "Call to action! It's time!" and a "Sign up" button to drive engagement.
- **Footer**: A simple copyright notice ("Copyright Â© 2025") for branding.
- **Stylish Aesthetics**: Consistent use of a dark-light color scheme and Flexbox for polished alignment.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structured with semantic tags (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`) for accessibility and clarity.
- **CSS3**: Leverages Flexbox for layout control and media queries for responsiveness.
- **Git**: Manages version control and repository history.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the live demo for public access.

- Implemented responsive design with media queries, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Experimented with color schemes and typography for a cohesive look.
- Troubleshot layout issues, improving my debugging skills.
